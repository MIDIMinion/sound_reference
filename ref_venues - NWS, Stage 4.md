340 W 50th St.

**Stage Door on 49th St**

## Notes
* It seems that the house rake changes as you move from the front row to the back. PRG saw horses for tech tables come in different sizes that don't always accommodate the change of the rake. When renting sawhorses for tech tables, add apple boxes to better fit the rake of the house

## quirks
* as a building policy, any feeder run along handrails/the grid needs to have the pipe wrapped in rubber

## Trucking
* trucks must have commercial plates
* the max length of trucks cannot exceed 40' from bumper to bumper, including lift gate
* the max listed height of the truck cannot exceed 12'4"
