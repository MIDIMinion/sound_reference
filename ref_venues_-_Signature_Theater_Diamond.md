## Quirks
* you can't gaff tape to anything, you have to put down painters tape first, then gaff to that
* there's an in-house sound system. UPQ/UPA clusters on left and right, UPA on center. The left/right clusters can't be struck, but the center UPA can
* there's only one cable passthrough from outside the theater to inside. It's located in the USR light lock and leads back towards the dressing room
* there's a cable passthrough between the SM booth in the back of the house and the HR box position
* USR and backstage gets terribly drafty in the winter. dress warmly.
