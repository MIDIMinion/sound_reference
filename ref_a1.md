# A1 - Reference Notes

## Console Layouts

### Assassins
* QL5 - Jacob Montgomery setup his custom fader layers as follows:
	* layer 1: band inputs with last bank of 8 being DCAs
	* layer 2: RF inputs with last bank of 8 being DCAs
* this lets him pop between band and actors while keeping his DCAs floating on top the whole time
	* if a third layer is available, maybe add one for QLab?
