## Road Cases
[Masque Roadcases](https://soundreferencenotes.com/ref_road_cases.html)


## Keep in Mind
* Masque **does not** stock a lot of 75' cable (mostly mult). If you're thinking of using 75' cable in your system, consider bumping it up to 100'
* Masque **does not** rent chain motors
* Masque **does not** rent sandbags
* Mostly 1RU stek panels, but some 2RU UCP frames
* G1, G2, & G3 block tails
* Masque doesn't do 12pr mult, 11pr instead

## Good Practice
* Tell shop rep approx. how many bundles so they can plan for bundle labor

## Fun
* It's $80 to buy bagels for the whole shop for a morning. Talk to Leslie about organizing bagels, get her cash before hand
