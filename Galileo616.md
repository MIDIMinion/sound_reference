### Working with a Galileo 616

The Galileo 616 is a "loudspeaker management system" with 6 XLR inputs and 16 XLR outputs.  
Its purpose varies per system, but in systems featuring one or more Galileo 616s, users often purpose the Galileo with system tuning an system alignment.  

Released in 2005, the 616 is still around in the new york city scene as of 2024 because of its utility, dependability, and lower weekly rental cost compared to newer Meyer loudspeaker management systems like the Galaxy 816.  

Prospective users should note carefully that to run the Compass control software, 3.12.1, a Mac computer cannot have an operating newer than Mac os13, Ventura.
Refer [this Meyer webpage](https://meyersound.com/product/compass/#software) for software download. Please be advised that Compass 4.x.x is not able to control a Galileo 616.
