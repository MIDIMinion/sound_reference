* no orchestra pit lift. there are's an elevator USL for getting boxes/instruments down to the orchestra pit/trap room

## Show Specific Notes
* **Grinch 2023:** ampland was put in a small room SL, instead of in the wingspace because of space concerns for large scenery. They were able to fit the following racks in there:
	* 2 @ 24U Dual Fast Pack (Amp & Com/Vid Racks)
	* 1 @ 24U Fast Pack (RF)
	* 1 @ PD/ISO, stacked (PD on top, ISO on bottom)
	* a workbox table for the A2
