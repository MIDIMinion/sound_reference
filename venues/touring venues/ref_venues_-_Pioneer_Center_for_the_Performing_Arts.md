## Quirks
* this venue has an elevator instead of a loading dock. the elevator can hit 3 heights: truck level, street level, and stage level. Unloading trucks is straightforward, however loading trucks takes additional thought. you have to stage roadcases at stage level, in front of the elevator, in the reverse order of the truck pack
	* the elevator will bind if it's loaded unevenly (the locals have a lot of practice in loading it evenly). Each truck will probably be 3-4 elevator trips
* most of the SR wing space is in front of the loading doors. putting both dimmer beach and ampland on SR may help load in/load out go smoothly
	* if you put ampland SR, you'll need ~150' of feeder to tie into the disconnect on SL
* no orchestra pit lift. there's a truss on chain motors that is used to lower things into the pit.


## Notes
* house usually removes the 2 rows of seats in front of the mix position, to make more room for FOH


## Storage
* there's a smaller blackbox space behind the theater that's usually used for storage. it involves a push up a long ramp at stage level


## Food, Drink, Coffee
* Sizzle Pie
* Pine State Biscuits
* Press Start
* Death and Taxes
* Eldorado Brew Brothers
