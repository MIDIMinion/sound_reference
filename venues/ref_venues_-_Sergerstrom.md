* located SL
* venue has 2 sets of delay sends, one for under balcs, one for over balcs.
	* house can also control delay speakers in zones. talk with James if you'd like to balance things out by zone
	* house delays are all time aligned to their zero point, so not too much delay should be needed in your sends

## Quirks
* the house is split up into 4 asymmetrical seating sections. look at drawings/photos to plan your coverage
	* the general concensus from the local crew is to just treat the venue like most other venues. get symmetrical coverage horizontally and vertically, and let the house delays fill in the weird spots
