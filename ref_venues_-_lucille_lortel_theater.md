## Notes
* no elevator up to balcony
* booth for light board op is in the back of the balcony
* 14 RU racks can fit under the stage, but the floor under the deck is not uniform
* keep 2 utility cases/half cubes for spare Cable in the alley, under a tarp
* if any department is renting ladders, rent a spare 6ft/8ft ladder
* 100A service in the booth for sound
* In house dressing room/program system, through an Alen & Heath console located in the booth
* the audience floor has a weird slope. Bring lots of shims and small blocks of 2x4's to prop things up level
* firecode emergency egress clearance for the back alley is "supposedly" 44", instead of the standard 36". Take this into consideration when storing things in the alley
