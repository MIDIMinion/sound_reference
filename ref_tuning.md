# Tuning - Reference Notes

### Arrays
* Start with your box that has the farthest throw (box a)
* EQ it to your desired freq response.
* then tune the next box down (box b) to match the previous box (box a vs. box b)
* move onto the third box (box c) and tune it to match the previous boxes (box a + b vs. box c)
* continue on down through the array.
* keep in mind that the low end response is going to change as you add more boxes into the array
