# Array Calc - Reference Notes

## Importing Venues into Array Calc
* Array Calc uses a plug-in for SketchUp called ArrayCalc Exchange to turn SketchUp drawings into .dbacv venue files that can be imported into Array Calc. SketchUp is an extra step but can provide a good place to organize surfaces and draw simplified 3D surfaces before importing.

## Exporting Systems from Array Calc as DXF
While on the sources tab: navigate to File > Export > DXF and choose if you want to export only the sources you have selected or all sources.

## Importing Array Calc DXFs into Vectorworks
1. File > Import > Import Single DXF/DWG
2. Navigate to and open the file
4. Import using **Millimeters**
5. Tools > Organization: Design Layers Tab > Scale
	* make sure to set the scale of the imported layer to the scale you're working at

## Array Calc and R1 File Management
* Array Calc(Prediction) and R1(Amplifier Control) share a single file called a .dbpr. Your computer will default to opening the file in one program or another so use right-click and open in to choose the correct one.
* These software work in tandem with each other. As they have developed you can only do some things you can only change in Array Calc and are greyed out in R1.
  * Do as much as you can to set amp IDs, types, etc in Array Calc to make for easy migration to R1.

## Further Education
D&B Has a lot of free resources available to learn the basics of Array Calc and R1. In addition to regularly scheduled online training, there are videos available on their website.

## Things to keep in mind
* Array Calc exports DXF files in millimeters regardless of your project settings.
* To avoid clearing things out or Array Calc chugging to open your last file when you open the software, disable "Load last project on program start" and "Start new project with example data" in the Array Calc preferences.
* Many loading errors in Array Calc and R1 can show up when you create a file in a version of the software thats newer than the one you are opening in. Check for updates is your friend as there are frequent updates to both.
