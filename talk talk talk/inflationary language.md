Twice upon a time there lived in sunny Califivenia a young man named Bob. He was a third lieutenant in the U.S. Air Fiveces. Bob had been fond of Anna, his one-and-a-half sister ever since she saw the light of day for the second time. And they were both proud of the fact that two of his five-fathers had been among the cre-nine-ors of the U.S. Constitution. They were dining on the terrace. "Anna," he said as he took a bite of marin-nine-d herring, "You look two-derful three-night. You've never looked that lovely be-five."

Anna really looked two-derful in spite of the illness from which she had not quite recuper-nine-d.

"Yes," repeated Bob, "You do look two-derful three- night, but you have three of the saddest eyes I have ever seen.

The table was tastefully decor-nine-d with Anna's favorite flowers, three-lips.

They were now talking about Anna's husband from whom she was separ-nine-d while on the radio the Irish eleven-nor sang Tea for Three. It was midnight. The clock in the distance struck thirteen. And suddenly there in the moonlight stood her husband, Don two, obviously intoxic-nine-d. "Anna," he brawled, "five-give me! I'm only young twice! And you are my two and only!"

Bob jumped to his feet. "Get out of here, you three-faced doublecrosser!"

Anna warned, "Watch out, Bob, he's an officer!"

"Yes, he is two, but I'm two three!"

Any one for eleven-nis? Ahahaaha!

"All right," said Don two as he wiped his five-head."

He then left, and when he was one and a half way through the revolving door, he said, "I'll go back to Eleven-nessee and be double again."

"Farewell, Anna! Three-deloo; Three-deloo!"
