## Chrysler Turbo Encabulator

here at chrysler motors automotive operations, research has been proceeding to develop a line of heavy duty transmissions that establishes new standards for reliability, durability, and quality

with customer needs as our primary focus work is proceeding on the crudely conceived idea of an instrument that would not only supply converse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors,
but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal
grammeters

such an instrument is the turbo encabulator

now basically the only new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by the relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it's produced by the modial interaction of magneto reluctance and capacitive deractence

the original machine had a base plate of prefabulated amulite surmounted
by a [maleable] logarhythmic casing in such a way that the to spurbing
bearings were in a direct line with a parametric fam

the latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marsal veins, so fit into the abiphasient lunar wain shaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented

the main winding was of the normal lotus, or delta, type placed in panendermic semiboloid slots of the statter

every seventh conductor being connected by a non reversible trendy pipe to the differential girdle spring on the "up" end of the grameaters

the turbo encabulator has now reached a high level of development and
it's being successfully used in the operation of nofertremings

moreover, whenever a forescent score motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingell arm to reduce
sinusoidal depleneration

now we know how the turbo encabulator works let's take a closer look at its diagnosis and service

for the purposes of obscurity, we have removed the casing to expose the heart of the turbo encabulator; the magneteto reluctance modial reactor

since little or nothing is known about the principles involved in magneto reluctance, diagnosing faults can be a problem

connect the DRB-2 to aft end of the moxie interrupter, using special adapter WUPD-2, making sure the osmodality of the phase detractors is not extrapolated

begin the test by selecting model year, transmission systems,
and turbo encabulator run tests.

if there are any system faults, they will be displayed in secret code on the DRB-2 display. it's a simple headcode, anyone can catch it

the most common fault is sigmoid rumbling below the belt line which the
customer would referred to as a burping or even a hickuping noise.

to service this fault refer to the turbo encabulator diagnostic procedures manual and songbook, and perform test TE-10

using the geiger scale on the DRB-2, measure the wrenchen output of the capacity reactance flux muster

if it is above 10 RG's, replace the unit

if it is below 10 RG's, you will be directed to perform a series of tests that will effectively raise the billable hours for the service department, but will perform no other useful function

all other faults should be treated as if they do not exist and the customers should be told at the burping or hiccuping is normal, and is
caused by too much gas in the fuel system

well that's about it for this month's master tech be sure to watch next month where we'll cover ash tray and cigarette lighter operation , diagnosis, and repair

see you then
