# I Like Words

Dear Sir,

I Like Words.

I like fat, buttery words such as ooze, terpitude, glutinous, toady.

I like solemn, angular, creeky words such as straight-laced, cantankerous, pecunious, valedictory.

I like spurious, black-is-white words such as mortician, liquidate, tonsorial, demimonde.

I like suave "V" words such as svengali, svelt, bravura, verve.

I like crunchy, brittle, crackly words such as splinter, grapple, jostle, crusty.

I like sullen, crabbed, scowling words such as skulk, glower, scabby, churl.

I like "oh heavens my gracious land's sake" words such as trixie, tucker, genteel, horrid.

I like wormy, squirmy, mealy words such as crawl, blubber, squeal, drip.

I like sneakily, chuckling words such as cowlick, gurgle, burble, and burp.

I like the word screenwriter better than the word copywriter, so I decided to quite my job in New York in an advertising agency, and try my luck in Hollywood. Before taking the plunge, I went to Europe for a year of study, contemplation, and horsing around. 

I've just returned, and I still like words.

May I have a few with you?

- Robert Pirosh

#### History
In 1934, a New York copywriter by the name of Robert Pirosh quit his well-paid job and headed for Hollywood, determined to begin the career of his dreams as a screenwriter. When he arrived, he gathered the names and addresses of as many directors, producers and studio executives as he could find, and sent them what is surely one of the greatest, most effective cover letters ever to be written; a letter which secured him three interviews, one of which led to his job as a junior writer at MGM.

Fifteen years later, screenwriter Robert Pirosh won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his work on the war film, Battleground. A few months after that, he also won a Golden Globe.
