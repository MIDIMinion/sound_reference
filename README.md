just some reference notes for noisy folks


## A Quick Note 11.20.22
this is definitely a rough first pass. lots of info to update, organize, and add! not sure if comments or issues are the best way for users to submit feedback or offer info to add, so just try something and we'll figure it out!

thanks,
mike
