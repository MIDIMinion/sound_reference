# Meyer Mapp 3D - Reference Notes

## Importing Venues into Mapp 3D
*ugh. there's no good way to import venues into Mapp 3D from Vectorworks. Coming soon: useful info to know, to make the process of building a venue from scratch suck a little less*

## Exporting Systems Into Vectorworks from Mapp 3D
1. File > Import > Import Single DXF/DWG
2. Navigate to and open file
3. Import using **Meters**
4. Tools > Organization: Design Layers Tab > Scale
	* make sure to set the scale of the imported layer to the scale you're working at

## Things to keep in mind
* Mapp 3D exports in meters, regardless of your project settings
