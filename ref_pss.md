# Production Sound Supervisor - Reference Notes

## Paperwork and Labels
* Having 2 days to prep labels and paperwork before crew arrives in the shop is super helpful. Organizing labels into piles that can be handed to crew saves a lot of time looking for labels and reference check lists


## Work Flow/Organization Ideas
* During shop prep, have three places where crew can grab label or rack paperwork: new, in progress, and completed
    * Crew grabs new bundle/cable labels/rack drawings, and info sheets from the "new" place. Crew returns completed tasks to the "completed place, so I can check them off. "In progress" place is for tasks that have been started but not completed
        * like for not finishing something before end of day, or waiting on gear from the shops
* paper folders for organizing drawings and labels
    * equipment lists
    * rack drawings
    * check lists and bundle sheets
    * tail labels
    * medium labels
    * big labels
    * individual cable labels

#### Folders
Checklists in the left pocket, labels in the right pocket. Labels for bundles get paper stapled to their bundle sheet
* Tails/panels/stage boxes
* bundles
* loose cable
* Stek labels
* Rack drawings
* signal flows
* equipment lists and schedules


## Tech Expectations (Tech-xpectations)
* Have a conversation with the design team ahead of time about what their expectations are for tech coverage
    * If they want me to stay for the entirety of tech rehearsals, then I need an assistant to come in and handle notes in the morning. I may need their help to get that money approved with PM
* have a discussion about how often they want tech tables for preview rehearsals, and how that compares with my labor budget
